# getting and cleaning data course project

## the repository contains the course project for Courseras getting and cleaning data.

The script called run_analysis.R reads the data set in. This is origined from a smartphone accelerometer.
This data needs to be in the working directory to be read.
The script merges the files of training and test data.
It extracts just the mean and standard deviation data for each measurement.
The script labels the columns appropiately and makes a complete data file 
with all required information.
Finally, it writes a txt file, called tidy.txt with average values for each variable of each activity and each subject.

variables are explained in the codebook.
